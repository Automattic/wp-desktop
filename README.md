# WordPress.com for Desktop

WordPress.com for Desktop is an [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron) wrapper for [Calypso](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso), the new WordPress.com front-end. It works on Mac, Windows, and Linux.

# Getting Started & Running Locally

1. Clone this repository locally
1. Update the Calypso submodule with:

- `git submodule init`
- `git submodule update`

1. Create a `calypso/config/secrets.json` file and fill it with [secrets](docs/secrets.md)
1. `npm install` will download all the required packages
1. `make build` to create the builds
1. Find the built apps in the `release` folder

Need more detailed instructions? [We have them.](docs/install.md)

# Development

The app is split between Electron code and Calypso code, and so the [development guide](docs/development.md) may help you find where to change stuff.

# Running The End-To-End Test Suite

1. Set the environment variables `E2EUSERNAME` and `E2EPASSWORD`.
2. Use `npm run e2e` or `make e2e` to invoke the test suite.

# MacOS Notarization

Per the current [Electron docs](https://www.electron.build/configuration/dmg), DMG signing is disabled by default as it will "lead to unwanted errors in combination with notarization requirements." Only the app bundle is zipped and submitted to Apple for notarization.

## Extracting Published ZIP Archive in MacOS 10.15 (Catalina)

There is a [known bug](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/4299#issuecomment-544683923) in which extracting notarized contents from a zip archive via double-click will lead to an invalid .app bundle that cannot be opened in macOS 10.15. Instead, the bundled app should be extracted via `ditto`:

`ditto -x -k <zip archive> <destination folder>`

## Verification

Notarization status of an application bundle can be verified via the `codesign`, `stapler` and `spctl` utilities:

`codesign --test-requirement="=notarized" --verify --verbose WordPress.com.app`

`xrun stapler validate WordPress.com.app`

`spctl -a -v WordPress.com.app`

# Building & Packaging a Release

While running the app locally in a development environment is great, you will eventually need to [build a release version](docs/release.md) you can share.
